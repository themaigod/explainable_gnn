General Deployment Functions
============================

This suite of functions is designed to facilitate various deployment actions within a deployment system. These functions are planned for future implementation and will provide critical functionalities for managing model deployments across different types of devices.

.. function:: _general_deploy_method(deploy_model, **kwargs)

   Intended to deploy a model to a specified environment. This function will handle the deployment logic based on the model and additional arguments provided.

   :param deploy_model: The model to be deployed.
   :param kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments specific to the deployment details and environment.

   .. note::
      TODO: Implement the function to deploy models according to specified parameters.

   Example usage:
   .. code-block:: python

       _general_deploy_method(my_model, environment="production", version=1.2)

.. function:: _general_deploy2multi_device(deploy_model, devices)

   Planned to deploy a model across multiple devices simultaneously, ensuring that the model is appropriately configured for each device.

   :param deploy_model: The model to be deployed.
   :param devices: A list of devices to which the model will be deployed.

   .. note::
      TODO: Implement the function to handle complex deployment scenarios across multiple devices.

   Example usage:
   .. code-block:: python

       _general_deploy2multi_device(my_model, [device1, device2])

.. function:: _general_add_device_to_multi_device(deploy_model, device)

   Intended to add a new device to an existing multi-device deployment configuration. This function will update the deployment setup to include the new device.

   :param deploy_model: The model currently deployed.
   :param device: The new device to add to the deployment configuration.

   .. note::
      TODO: Implement the function to dynamically add devices to ongoing deployments.

   Example usage:
   .. code-block:: python

       _general_add_device_to_multi_device(existing_deployment, new_device)

.. function:: _general_remove_device_from_multi_device(deploy_model, device)

   Planned to remove a device from an existing multi-device deployment configuration. This function will adjust the deployment to operate without the specified device.

   :param deploy_model: The model currently deployed.
   :param device: The device to be removed from the deployment configuration.

   .. note::
      TODO: Implement the function to dynamically remove devices from ongoing deployments.

   Example usage:
   .. code-block:: python

       _general_remove_device_from_multi_device(existing_deployment, obsolete_device)

Notes
-----
- These functions are crucial for systems where deployments need to be adaptable and capable of scaling across various devices and environments.
- The detailed implementation of these functions will need to consider factors such as device compatibility, network configuration, and deployment rollback capabilities.

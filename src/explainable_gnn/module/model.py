    """
    BaseModule Class
    ================

    The ``BaseModule`` class serves as an abstract base class (ABC) for all module types within a system that integrates with PyTorch's neural network module system. This class ensures that all modules conform to a required interface and can be recognized and handled uniformly across the framework.

    Description
    -----------
    ``BaseModule`` acts as a foundational component that standardizes module functionality by ensuring that any module, particularly those derived from ``torch.nn.Module``, is registered and acknowledged as a subclass of ``BaseModule``. This registration is crucial for maintaining consistency and interoperability within libraries that depend on these types.

    Purpose
    -------
    The primary purpose of the ``BaseModule`` is to:
    - Provide a common base class for all neural network modules, facilitating the implementation of generic functions and methods that operate on a wide range of modules.
    - Ensure that all modules integrated into the framework are compatible with PyTorch's ``nn.Module``, allowing seamless usage of both custom and PyTorch-provided modules.

    Usage
    -----
    To utilize this class, developers should ensure that any custom module classes they create are registered as subclasses of ``BaseModule`` if they also inherit from ``torch.nn.Module``. This registration can be explicitly stated in the module's class definition or handled programmatically as shown in the class setup.

    Code Example
    ------------
    .. code-block:: python

        import torch.nn as nn

        class MyCustomModule(nn.Module, BaseModule):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                # module initialization logic here

    Alternatively, for automatic handling:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Registering torch.nn.Module as a subclass of BaseModule to ensure compatibility
        BaseModule.register(nn.Module)

        class AnotherCustomModule(nn.Module):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                # additional setup here

    Notes
    -----
    - While Python's ABC does not enforce the instantiation checks or subclass checks at runtime by default, using the ``register`` method of an ABC allows for the explicit declaration of intent that a certain class should be considered a subclass of the ABC, even if it does not directly inherit from it.
    - This approach is particularly useful in large systems where modules from various sources (internal, external, third-party) need to interact seamlessly, ensuring that all modules meet a baseline level of functionality and compatibility.

    .. note::
       It is critical that all main input modules, especially those directly used within the broader framework or system, are registered as subclasses of ``BaseModule`` to maintain system integrity and module interoperability.

    Conclusion
    ----------
    The ``BaseModule`` class is a strategic implementation detail designed to enhance module management and integration within PyTorch-based systems, promoting a more organized and reliable development environment.

class Model(BaseModule):
    """
    Model Class
    ===========

    The ``Model`` class is a specialized subclass of the ``BaseModule`` intended to serve as the foundational class for all models in the Explainable GNN framework. This class helps in identifying and managing models, ensuring that all model types conform to a standardized framework structure.

    Purpose
    -------
    The main purpose of the ``Model`` class is to:
    - Provide a recognizable base for all models developed within or for the Explainable GNN framework.
    - Facilitate the easy identification and categorization of models as part of the system, enhancing manageability and compatibility across various components of the framework.
    - Ensure that all models inherit from ``BaseModule``, leveraging the robustness and features established by the base class.

    Usage
    -----
    As a base class, ``Model`` should be extended by any specific model implementations within the Explainable GNN framework. It does not implement specific functionalities but ensures that any subclass aligns with the framework's requirements and standards.

    Developers should subclass ``Model`` when creating new model types to maintain consistency and interoperability within the framework:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyCustomModel(Model):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                # Initialization and model-specific logic here

    By using ``Model`` as the base class, developers ensure that their custom models integrate seamlessly with the framework and other components expecting instances derived from ``Model`` or ``BaseModule``.

    Example
    -------
    Creating a new model that inherits from ``Model``:

    .. code-block:: python

        class ExampleModel(Model):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                # Additional setup and layer definitions

    This subclassing makes ``ExampleModel`` a part of the broader Explainable GNN model ecosystem, automatically incorporating it into the framework's module management and processing pipelines.

    Notes
    -----
    - Subclassing ``Model`` is crucial for developers aiming to contribute new model types to the Explainable GNN framework or for those developing proprietary models based on the framework.
    - The ``Model`` class acts as a marker within the framework, indicating that the class is intended for use as a model rather than a general-purpose module.

    Conclusion
    ----------
    The ``Model`` class is strategically important for maintaining a structured and unified approach to model development within the Explainable GNN framework. It ensures that all models adhere to the framework's design principles and are compatible with its architecture and operational protocols.
